# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# TODO App with Redux and React JS

The ToDo app is a simple task management tool built using React and Redux. Users can list their tasks, mark them as complete, and add new ones. In addition to the core features, I've added bonus functionalities like search, filtering, deletion, and task modification to enhance the user experience.
