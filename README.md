# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# TODO App with Redux and React JS
The ToDo app is a straightforward task management tool built using React and Redux. Users can list their tasks, mark them as complete, and add new ones. Alongside core features, I've incorporated bonus functionalities like search, filtering, deletion, and task modification to enrich user experience.
