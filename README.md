# TODO App with Redux and React JS
The ToDo app is a straightforward task management tool built using React and Redux. Users can list their tasks, mark them as complete, and add new ones. Alongside core features, I've incorporated bonus functionalities like search, filtering, deletion, and task modification to enrich user experience.
